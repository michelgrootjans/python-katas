# Python katas
This is a setup directory to start python katas
I'm playing around with demoing cucumber, with ruby however

## TDD
to start the python kata run:
> docker-compose run tdd

You can then start writing tests in the `tests` directory

## BDD
to start the BDD run:
> docker-compose run bdd

You can then start writing features in the `features` directory
